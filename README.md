##openvpn-install

I am using Nyr/Openvpn-install to learn about using scripts in GitHub

###Installation

Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget git.io/vpn --no-check-certificate -O openvpn-install.sh; bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

###I use PrivateTunnel as my VPN.
