##openvpn-install

I am using Nyr/openvpn-install to learn about using scripts in GitHub. If you looking for a script for Debian, Ubuntu or CentOS, which will setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, go to Nyr/openvpn-install. Don't use anything here. 

###Installation

Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget git.io/vpn --no-check-certificate -O openvpn-install.sh; bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

###Private Tunnel (from the developers of OpenVPN software). 

I use Private Tunnel as my VPN provider, using OpenVPN software installed on Linux Mint 17.2.
